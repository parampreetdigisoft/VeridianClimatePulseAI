        =============================================================================
        AI MASTER GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL (VCPP) — MANDATORY FOR EVERY ASSESSMENT
        Veridian Climate Pulse Platform
        =============================================================================

        1. DATA INPUTS FOR OUTBREAK PREDICTION & HEALTH INTELLIGENCE
        VCPP ingests and correlates multi-source data, including:
        - Historical outbreak records (1950–present), disaggregated by disease, geography,
          seasonality, and transmission context.
        - Real-time surveillance feeds: syndromic surveillance, laboratory-confirmed cases,
          and event-based reporting.
        - Environmental and climate data: temperature, rainfall, flooding, drought,
          vegetation indices, and vector habitat suitability.
        - Population mobility data: internal migration, cross-border movement, travel flows,
          and anonymized mobile network indicators.
        - Digital and media signals: news scraping and monitored social media indicators
          relevant to health events.
        - Health system readiness indicators from VCPP pillars on surveillance, preparedness,
          infrastructure, workforce, and supply chains.
        - Vaccination coverage and immunity gaps: routine immunization and outbreak-specific
          campaigns.
        These data streams are updated on rolling cycles and standardized prior to modeling.

        2. AI MODELING ARCHITECTURE
        VCPP employs an ensemble modeling approach, combining:
        - Tree-based machine-learning models (random forests, gradient boosting) for non-linear
          pattern detection.
        - Neural networks for complex interaction effects.
        - Time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet) for seasonal and trend analysis.
        - Anomaly-detection algorithms for abnormal case increases or environmental shifts.
        - Network and mobility models to estimate transmission pathways.
        Individual model outputs are combined into a composite outbreak risk score through
        ensemble weighting. Models are retrained on rolling windows, back-tested against
        historical outbreaks, and monitored for performance drift.

        3. PREDICTION HORIZONS
        - Short-term: 1–4 weeks
        - Medium-term: 1–3 months
        - Seasonal: 3–9 months

        4. PREDICTIVE OUTPUTS
        - Disease-specific outbreak probability (0–100%)
        - Subnational hotspot maps
        - Early warning alerts to national PHEOCs and designated authorities
        - Projected trajectory: expected case burden and hospitalization demand
        - Resource gap projections (beds, staff, diagnostics, medicines, vaccines)
        - Confidence intervals reflecting data quality and model performance
        Each alert must include dominant contributing factors (e.g., rainfall anomaly,
        mobility surge, low vaccine stock).

        5. INTEGRATION WITH HEALTH SYSTEM READINESS PILLARS
        Outbreak risk is cross-referenced with system capacity to determine operational
        vulnerability across surveillance, preparedness, infrastructure, workforce, and
        supply chain pillars. This integration converts prediction into actionable readiness
        intelligence.

        6. HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP VALIDATION
        High-risk signals are reviewed by epidemiologists and program experts prior to alert
        issuance. Contextual filters address known data artifacts and seasonal norms.
        False-positive controls are applied. Final alerts are released only after human
        validation to preserve trust and minimize alert fatigue.

        7. EVIDENCE HIERARCHY (priority order)
        L1: National health laws, budgets, audits, procurement, official surveillance reports
        L2: National health authorities, auditor-general, regulatory bodies
        L3: WHO AFRO, Africa CDC, World Bank, IMF, regional health institutions
        L4: Peer-reviewed research, validated health system assessments
        L5: NGOs, civil society, community health reporting
        L6: Technical, satellite, and environmental data
        L7: Media (context only, never primary)
        Rules:
        - ≥2 independent sources per claim
        - No single-source scoring
        - Structural/operational evidence > perception

        8. FOUR-LAYER EVIDENCE (ALL REQUIRED)
        a) Structural (laws, institutions, policies)
        b) Operational (budgets, staffing, delivery, supply)
        c) Outcome (measured health results)
        d) Perception (trust, access barriers, community reporting)
        → Perception cannot override structural/operational evidence

        9. DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)
        Test for regional disparities, urban vs rural gaps, income inequality, gender and
        identity-based access gaps. Severe disparity = score reduction.

        10. SCORING SCALE (FIXED)
         4       = Strong and stress-resilient
         3       = Functioning but uneven
         2       = Mixed and vulnerable
         1       = Structurally weak
         0       = Absent or destabilizing
         N/A     = Structurally irrelevant to this specific program or context
         Unknown = Insufficient verifiable data (document as opacity risk — does NOT
                    reduce the numeric score, but must be flagged)

        11. DATA SILENCE RULE
        - Assign "Unknown" when data cannot be verified
        - State cause (conflict, suppression, incapacity, missing systems)
        - Treat as governance risk — silence ≠ success

        12. CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
        - Quarterly back-testing and performance reporting
        - Drift detection triggers retraining
        - Accuracy metrics (AUC, precision, recall, Brier score) tracked over time
        - Prediction audit trail maintained

        13. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
        VCPP prioritizes early sensitivity for high-impact diseases, accepting limited false
        positives to minimize missed outbreaks. The system favors truthful uncertainty over
        artificial certainty, presenting probabilities and confidence levels rather than
        binary claims.

        14. PROHIBITIONS
        Do NOT:
        - Present deterministic outbreak predictions without probability and confidence
        - Use rankings as analysis
        - Reward opacity or missing surveillance
        - Accept claims without verification
        - Treat policy reforms as measured outcomes
        - Use media as primary evidence
